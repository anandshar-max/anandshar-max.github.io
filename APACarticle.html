                    <h2 style="text-align: center; padding-bottom: 40px;">Future of Venture Capital: Algorithms powering the gatekeepers of new technology</h2>
                    <p>We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters. </p>
<p>The words marked the tagline of Founder’s Fund, a venture capital firm owned by Peter Thiel, PayPal’s co-founder, and early Facebook investor. Over time, the wheel of breakthrough innovations seems to be slackening, rendering the finite resource of innovations ever more scarce. </p>
<p>The whimsical odyssey of evolving algorithms, however, paints a different picture. Intelligent systems are changing the way we work, live, interact, and even perceive our environment. Technology is winning Go world championships, natural language processing algorithms are decoding human emotions, smart systems are shaping our daily routines, and every idea is a promise to the next big innovation breakthrough. </p>
<p>The venture capital industry is not untouched. Next-gen technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, and AR / VR, has been making its foray into the venture capital/accelerator industry to redefine the startup investment ecosystem. Venture Capital firms are the cusp of transformation, driven by disruptive technological advancements. Firms are looking at AI and Machine Learning to help them hire, land potential deals, and undergo extensive due diligence. </p>
<h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Algorithms' wider implications </h3>
<p>Venture Capital firms are riding the wave of machine learning algorithms to process millions of data points to create recommendations for outlier companies that promise to make it big. </p>
<p>These patterns and outlier anomalies, however, fail to assess more qualitative factors. As we progress, learning algorithms might become closer to actual decisions/criteria used to evaluate the viability of startups. Furthermore, VCs are considering the idea of integrating human feedback into the assessment to provide a qualitative outlook. This humanoid feedback can come in two ways: </p>
<li>Focused interviews or surveys about the company offerings. </li>
<li>Informed feedback routed via a network of experienced investors. </li>
<p></p>
<p>Startups like Kensho and StartupYard’s Decissio are leveraging AI to drive investment decisions by navigating through large amounts of data points. Machine learning models are fostering channels providing greater access to deal flow and investment decision making revamping the VC landscape. Technology is also getting leveraged to scan prospective company financing, intellectual property rights, analyzing product trials, and previous funding rounds. </p>
<p>Deep knowledge ventures, Hong Kong’s life science venture firm, for instance, has made its foray into helping the firm make investment decisions for startups focused on age-related drugs and regenerative medicine projects. </p>
<h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Cloud Computing and Investment Portfolios </h3>
<p>The advent of cloud computing has opened gates to new investment opportunities. The sheer number of investments in the startup ecosystem has nearly doubled from the pre-cloud to post – cloud era relative to unaffected sectors. Disruptive cloud services have allowed internet and web-based startups to work past initial large capital investments. It has significantly decreased the initial costs of venture capital funding into startup experiments, without impacting the cost of scaling successful businesses. </p>
<p>The way venture capitals manage their portfolios is being revamped. VCs are putting efforts to allocate lesser funding and limited governance to startups in their portfolio. </p>
<p>The experimentation costs have enabled startup ventures to seize funding that would have been difficult in the pre-cloud era. It has caused massive shifts empowering entry into high tech entrepreneurship. That said, venture capitalist firms are now looking at young, less experienced founding teams. These are more likely to fail, but at the same instant, possess the potential to succeed dramatically. </p>
<p>The lesser focus on mentorship and governance have fostered new financial intermediaries powered through scalable, limited investment mentorships to lesser experienced founding teams. Cloud-enabled a tectonic technological shift that is altering the venture capital investment landscape revamping how ideas of tomorrow are getting funded. </p>
<h3 style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Blockchain-based tokenized funds </h3>
<p>Ensuring the General Partners and Limited Partners receive the correct share of returns instantly, smart blockchain-based contracts can help transfer money seamlessly. The application of blockchain-based tokenized funds is a solution to significant VC problems. </p>
<p>To cash out, investors hold up until the company exits or life of the funds run out. It makes limited partners face the dilemma of hanging around for a decade or longer to see the viability of the investment. The high minimum investment of funds restricts limited partners from diversifying their portfolios. </p>
<p>Tokenised funds act as the mirror of investor sentiments where token prices can vary directly as the result of fluctuations in the outlook of the investment. It provides a way for limited partners to cash out early by selling their token at the market price or even increase their holdings by buying more token. Equally, tokenized funds curb the problem of minimum investments allowing any accredited investor to purchase tokens.</p>
<p>Blockchain funds like Hackfund and Swarmfund are revamping the venture capital system by democratizing the way investments are taken. Tokenised funds are fostering the ability of startups to support sustainable and stable growth without worrying to scale-up quickly and exit early.</p>
<p>Venture Capital funds have had constant renovation over time with the advent of new technologies. The improvement is visible across every end of the spectrum, from democratizing venture capital firms and redefining investment portfolios to predicting and carrying out effective investment decisions. </p>
<p>While technology trends are not likely to replace human intelligence anytime soon, the disruptive dramatic reversal in the traditional ways of investment is redefining the focus on diligence methods, investment strategies, and data-driven startup landscape. </p>
